This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Prevent web scraping

Preventing web scraping in your Next.js endpoint can be challenging, as it's often difficult to completely block all scraping attempts. However, you can implement some measures to make scraping more difficult. Keep in mind that determined scrapers may still find ways to access your data. Here are some steps you can take to deter web scraping:

Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a specific time frame. This can help prevent automated scraping tools from making too many requests in a short period.

User Agent Checking: Scraper bots may use default or custom User Agents. You can check the User Agent of incoming requests and block or limit access for known scraper User Agents.

CAPTCHA: Implement CAPTCHA challenges for suspicious or high-frequency requests. This can help identify and block scraping bots.

Referrer Checking: Check the HTTP Referrer header to ensure that requests are originating from your website or a trusted source.

Session Management: Implement session management and cookies to track user sessions. This makes it more challenging for scrapers that do not support cookies.

API Key or Token: Require an API key or token for accessing your endpoint. Only provide keys or tokens to authorized users or applications.

Data Encryption: Use HTTPS to secure data transmission between the client and your server. This prevents data interception.

Regularly Monitor and Analyze Traffic: Keep an eye on your server logs to detect unusual or suspicious patterns in requests. For example, if you notice a high number of requests from a single IP address, it may be a scraper.

Employ Web Application Firewall (WAF): A Web Application Firewall can help filter out malicious traffic and provide an additional layer of protection against web scraping.

Terms of Service: Clearly define your website's terms of service and enforce them. This can include specifying what is considered acceptable use and prohibiting web scraping.

It's important to note that determined scrapers may still find ways to bypass these measures. Therefore, it's crucial to regularly review and update your security measures based on the evolving threat landscape.

Remember to strike a balance between protecting your data and ensuring that legitimate users can access your content. Some measures, such as strict rate limiting, can potentially impact user experience if not implemented carefully.
